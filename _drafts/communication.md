At the lowest level, I believe, everything is about communication. Information
exchange defines the human experience. Perhaps it even defines the universe,
but I'd guess that those intuitions are too colored by our own experiences.
If it's true that human (conscious?) is defined by information exchange, then
we might not even be able to reach the substrate on which the information
exchange happens.
