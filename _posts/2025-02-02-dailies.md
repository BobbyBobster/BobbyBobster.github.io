Was it World of Warcraft which first introduced daily quests to a game? It was definitely my first experience with a daily grinding mechanic. The idea behind that sort of "hook" is to keep players coming back and creating a habit of opening the game and performing some actions. That habit will add to the feeling of investment the players have in the game, which leverages the sunk-cost fallacy part of human reasoning and that in turn makes it harder for players to quit the game. By incentivizing to do something daily, the game engrains itself as part of our life.

Might there also be such a daily quest mechanic for habits we want to build from scratch? It would be pretty tough to create a daily incentive which encourages us to perform an action every day, when we're not in the habit of doing the action. Many techniques exist and apps have been created which solely rely on the "streak" mechanic. But I don't know of anything which (randomly) assigns tasks from a set list per day. Perhaps that would keep the habit-building fresh for longer such that the habit get engrained easier.
