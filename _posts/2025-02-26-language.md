We learn a new language because we have a need to communicate with people who
we currently cannot speak with. 
It might be that the people are dead, and we only have their writing.
It might be that we live in a society with people of a different background,
with a different mother tongue.
But always we want to communicate. We have a need to communicate, whether
internally felt or externally pressured. By learning a new language, we
actively take a step towards other people. We want to be able to talk to them, 
or have them talk to us. 

I guess I'm thinking more about speaking lately. The idea I got from some
cursory research on the web is that _the basis of language learning is input_.
Given enough (comprehensible) input, our brain will figure out the underlying
patterns and hence a language is "learned". Enough input will lead to natural
output, as we will try to mimic others. I'm trying to get enough input, but
I feel like I'm at a point where output should become more of a priority.
I'd like to be able to talk to people more. And if that's my goal, I should
practice that.
