title: Return to Debian
date: 2024-01-29

After a short stint with trying out Fedora as a daily driver, I've decided to move back to running Debian on my old laptop. Even though currently I'm mostly using my wife's Macbook, I like to have something for myself where I can control everything.
This time I've written the basic installation I want into an Ansible playbook. The playbook installs X11 and some of the [suckless.org](suckless.org) applications like [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), [st](https://st.suckless.org/), and [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/). This gives me a fast and minimal GUI. I've recently also been trying [qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/) for my browsing, but it's not installed via my playbook yet.

_After polishing the playbook a bit, a link to the repository will be placed here._
