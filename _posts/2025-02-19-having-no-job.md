Being out of a job for a while forces some strange feelings to the surface, at
least if you let them. 

Distractions are always around. Especially in this modern world, where we all
have our phones within arms reach practically all of the time. The black mirror
which flashes tiny lights at us, luring us into its magical world of sensuality.
Unlimited lights, sounds, and information can be had with minimal effort.
And this is great, it's amazing and wonderful that we live in an age of new
connections and borderless communication. The fact that I can learn a language
like Japanese without even having to search out a teacher for in-person lessons
is amazing. The fact that we can hear from so many people so many different
voices is wonderful.

Distractions are a part of life. It's part of what it means to be alive as an
evolutionary machine. As we're shaped into a certain optimizing niche, we will
inevitably have to look around and see what else is out there. This looking
around then distracts us from the "goal" we set ourselves.
