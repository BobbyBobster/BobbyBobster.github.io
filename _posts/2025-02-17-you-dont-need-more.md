title: You don't need more information

You don't need more information. You already have all the necessary knowledge
to take the next step. If more information is needed, it will reveal itself as
the next step to take.

I think any human living in the modern information age has a use for a similar
mantra as above. As we are being inundated with information and knowledge and
good-to-know tidbits, we habitualize ourselves to that feeling of overwhelming
information overload. That habit then rears its head when we try to sit down
and take action. We get the feeling that first it would be good to do some
research on the topic ahead. Some research then usually devolves in going down
one too many a rabbithole. This can take so much time and energy that we feel
exhausted and broken afterward. But we will pat ourselves on the back
nevertheless as we think we have made some good progress. All for the same
story to repeat itself at a later time. By trying to get a headstart on the
action, we have distracted ourselves from taking the action.
