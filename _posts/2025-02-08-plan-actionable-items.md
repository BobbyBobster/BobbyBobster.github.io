title: Plan actionable items

A plan can be called good not when it is meticulously elaborate and detailed,
it can only be called good when it is actionable. Actionability of planned items
is subjective. Every person responds differently to having to take an action.
Some people only need a general pointer of where to focus their mind and that's
enough to get the ball rolling. Others need detailed notes or a step-by-step
guide layed out before they can start. Whether an item is actionable is then a
consequence of whether the item includes the necessary information for the
person who's action it is to take. This includes an expectation of the state of
mind of the person during the scheduled time for a planned item. When there is
a high variance in the expected state of mind during the scheduled time, this
needs to be reflected in the contents of the planned item.

If we want to plan actionable items, we therefore need enough of an
understanding of the workings of the executor of the action. When we don't have
sufficient understanding, it then means that action has to proceed planning.
For ourselves this means, until we have knowledge and understanding of how we
act, our plans will fall short of being usable as they won't fit the shape of
our mind.
