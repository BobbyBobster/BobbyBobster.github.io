title: Our cat likes katsuobushi

Our cat likes the deep, fishy taste of katsuobushi (鰹節; bonito flakes). We
found out after sprinkling some on rice or tofu I think. She gets very excited
when we open up a bag, and it's been fun to sprinkle some on her kibble once
in a while. Apparently a lot of people are giving their cats katuobushi, so
I'm not worried that we're doing something wrong.
