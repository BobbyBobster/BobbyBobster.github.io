After getting sucked into the
[AJATT blog](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/foreword.html)
for a bit, I'm retracting my previous ideas about starting output practice.
The reasons for avoiding early output sound very convincing. Especially about
picking up bad habits which are hard to undo later down the road. When thinking
about my English ability, I definitely notice some of my own bad habits, which
I will most likely never lose. With Japanese I'd like to avoid that.

Of course I will start outputting sooner than the AJATT method recommends. As
I will want/need to communicate with Japanese people before being able to get
my 10,000 hours of input. But still, I don't think I'll focus on output for now.
