Learning a new language really shows how difficult communication is. How
much skill we need for transferring information in a subtle way. And how much
we subconsciously process while having a conversation.

Currently I'm almost solely doing input practice. The reason I tell myself for
this is that you first have to know what the words are before you can use them.
And to a certain extent that's true, but it also feels like a good way to
shield me from the discomfort of practicing output. I have a feeling that
I'm currently at a point where output practice will be more beneficial than
trying to expand my vocabulary. Not something major like trying to have a full
conversation in Japanese, but even starting small with speaking exercises, or
shadowing exercises. Letting my mouth, lips, and tongue get used to the shape
and position of Japanese.

I'm trying to write some posts on here in Japanese as well, for written output
practice. But it takes quite a large amount of effort just to write a couple
of sentences. Perhaps that's actually the cue that I should be doing it more.
