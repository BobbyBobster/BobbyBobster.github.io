Every time I embark on a sideproject, what feels like the "end" always ends up being just a waypoint to another, more definite feeling, "end". There's always something to improve, always something more to add. Maybe that's why the idea of an MVP is so powerful. When you've arrived at something small but usable, just push it out into the world. Get it in front of people, and they will immediately tell you what is wrong with it. Or not, there's a large possibility of being on the receiving end of a deafening silence once you try to show it to people. Both are fine, that's just how it goes.

I've just hit the MVP stage of my side project for creating an Anki flashcard controller. It ended up being a modded Wii Nunchuck controller which sends the input to your phone over Bluetooth using an ESP32C. It's just about usable, but also with alot of quirks.
