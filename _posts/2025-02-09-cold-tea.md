Cold teas are quite nice. I'd never given them a fair chance before coming to
Japan. To me cold tea equated to a sweet iced tea, which is more a soft drink
than tea. But after being gifted a cold-infusion bottle, drinking my first
cup of cold oolong tea opened my eyes. Especially in the hot and humid Japanese
summer, cold tea is very refreshing. My tastebuds are not yet ready for things
like barley tea, but I don't find it as bad as I used to at least.

Lately I've been trying to drink less coffee. It's not a bad habit to have, but
still I like to reduce my intake once in a while when I notice I'm drinking
three or more cups every day. This is a good time to increase my tea
consumption while decreasing my coffee consumption.
