Today we walked from Mejio station to Otsuka station. It's the second leg of
our Yamanote line walk, and again we kept it relatively short by only walking
two stations. It was nice to see that all neighborhoods in Tokyo we visited
until now have had their own personalities. 

We started by visiting Mejiro garden. It's a serene little spot tucked away
in a residential neighborhood. There's a teahouse which can be rented out for
not much money, but unfortunately not accessible for viewing. A cute couple
and photographer were taking what seemed to be wedding photos.

Ikebukuro has a reputation as a "seedy" place I'd heard. But of course, seedy
in Japan is quite different from what it can mean in other places. I found it
a charming neighborhood. More down-to-earth and approachable than for example
Shibuya. The streets are more messy and gocha-gocha than other places, but that
adds to the personality.

We ended the walk by having lunch in a hole-in-the-wall Shanghainese place. The
staff was the right amount of rough that we knew the food would be great. And
indeed, the tantanmen was delicious.
