I'm actively questioning the role of coffee in my days lately. The way I look
at when to drink coffee seems to correlate heavily with whether I think I need
a "boost". Not a boost energy-wise, but more motivation-wise. When there's a bit
of a slump or I'm not attending to the right things. This is quite normal I'd
say, but isn't the most optimal way of structuring my intake. The downside of
letting my perceived motivation level dictate my intake means some days I'm
drinking way too much. Coffee or caffeine by itself doesn't give the boost. But
even though I know that intuitively, that's not what I base my choices on.

More investigation is needed.
