The one distinction that has always stuck with me from Kondo Marie's book 
"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" is the difference between cleaning 
and tidying. She explains that cleaning is the act of physically cleansing an 
area or object, the act of making it clean. Tidying however is the act of 
deliberating on objects, asking whether the objects should still
even be in your life. Where cleaning is necessary for bodily health, tidying is
necessary for mental health.

This distinction often gets muddled, even in my own thinking. It's easy to 
conflate the two concepts because organizing is an integral part of tidying and
also usually part of cleaning. We then start to see the organizing aspect as the
defining aspect of tidying, through which we lose the deliberating aspect.
