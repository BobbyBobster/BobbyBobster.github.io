title: Triggers and signals

Noticing what kind of signals the mind receives is hard. As far as I see it's
also one of the main reasons for practicing meditation. By observing the mind
during a meditation session, you practice seeing the signals coming in, and
then learn to (not) respond to them. This is in contrast to when a signal sets
off a trigger, something which (for now) you don't have any control over. Those
signals start an avalance of other thoughts or actions, those actions can take
up your whole mindscape, and only later you wake up and see what happened.

Meditation is one of those things which seem hard to start for me. The seeming
contradiction of trying to cultivate a skill which requires you to (kind of)
not try is poses a hurdle for me. But still, as I'm in a period of trying to
regularize and cultivate my habits, I need to use some willpower to start.
