Like matter, the mind resists a change in motion. The concept of inertia 
applies to both. When the mind is in motion, it will resist stopping that 
motion. Starting an action is hard, continuing that same action is easier. 

What I'm not sure about is whether a still mind resists being put in motion as
well. My meditiation practice is not developed enough for me to know the
aspects of a still mind. Normally I'm doing something, be it actively 
or passively, before I want to make a change.
