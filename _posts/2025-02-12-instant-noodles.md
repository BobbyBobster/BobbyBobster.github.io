title: Instant noodles as a base

I've been called out for "ruining" instant noodles. You see, I like to add
vegetables and some protein like tofu to my noodles. It lets me enjoy some
salty and processed flavors, but also allows me to get at least some nutrition. 
Without any additions the noodles packets are generally too strong for me,
seeing as I normally try to not eat much processed foods. But apparently some
people don't see it that way. They say that I'm muddling their childhood
memories and current expectations on a bowl of instant noodles. The strong
junkfood flavor is the main attraction of the noodles, and that should be
preserved.
