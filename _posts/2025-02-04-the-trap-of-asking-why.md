title: The trap of asking why

Asking "why?", asking why something is the way it is, can be a great idea.
It can be a starting point to a deep investigative adventure which will teach
you things you never even heard about. But that's not always the case. I've
noticed that many times, the question is a distraction. The question is a
trick of the mind when it doesn't want to think about or do something. The mind 
gets uncomfortable and with a sleight of hand presents the 
"why are we uncomfortable?" question as an alternative option. The alternative 
is appealing because it promises us that we can find an underlying cause to the
discomfort, and knowing that underlying cause will enable us to fix the
discomfort at its root.  What the mind doesn't say, and maybe even doesn't
truly know, is that there is no way around the discomfort. There is no way
around the discomfort because the _discomfort is inherent in the doing_. The
discomfort is the doing in a way. We cannot receive the benefits of the doing
without the actual doing. No matter how deep we go, how many times we repeat
asking "why?", we will not get closer to doing the action. When asking it about
oneself and one's own thought patterns I would even say that there is little
to be gained. Knowledge can only be created by interaction. There is a need
for new information to enter the system, else all you're doing is navelgazing.

In a sense, it all comes back to that Nike slogan, just do it.
