I like hiking. Especially going up mountains is something that gives me a good
sense of accomplishment and a nice workout. Why I like it is probably
influenced by growing up in one of the flattest countries in the world. For me,
seeing a terrain with height elevations evokes feelings of holiday and fun.
During family holidays in France I would always look at the hills and cliffs
with wonder, speculating what could be on the other side.

Most mountains I go up are covered in trees. Some are more rocky than others
but for the vast majority they're forested. While the forest can be a place of
great beauty, I can also see why it's also been depicted as a grim and scary
place. Being in the woods as the sun is setting can be quite unnerving. A
tinge of uncertainty comes upon you, what will happen if you don't make it out
in time. When you're alone and having been walking for hours already, it
becomes painfully clear that the forest is not your home. In particular for an
urbanite like me, I'm just a visitor, a passerby.
