Hi, I'm Bastiaan Boland. Welcome to my GitHub profile.
I am always trying to learn new skills, currently I'm working through
[SICP](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm#)
and [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/).
Oh, and I'm looking for a job.

### Education
B.Sc. Econometrics and Operations Research at the University of Groningen. \
The repository for my 
[Bachelor's thesis Econometrics and Operations Research](https://github.com/BobbyBobster/thesis-panel-data/)
contains the full paper and all code used. All analysis was done in R.

At UG I finished courses like [Neural Networks](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WBAI028-05) 
and [Languages and Machines](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WBCS027-05). 

I also finished all three parts of the 
[C/C++ course by Frank B. Brokken and Jurjen Bokma](http://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/), 
covering OOP, advanced allocation and class construction schemes, 
generic algorithms, STL, templates, template meta-programming, 
basics of grammar and code-generating tools, and more.

The [MIT CSAIL Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) helped my 
understanding of digital workflows and the tools available for using computers
to solve problems.

### Interests
* C++
* WebAssembly
* Scheme
* R
* Domain Specific Languages
* DevOps
* Bahasa Indonesia
* Vim

### Miscellaneous
[How much faster is WebAssembly compared to JavaScript?](mandelbrot/mandelbrot.html) \
WebAssembly and the Emscripten workflow. Also first contact with S-expressions 
leading to interest in Lisp/Scheme/Racket.

[Chaotic attractors](chaotic/chaotic.html) \
JavaScript, canvas, and creating pretty pictures. Might add some 3D ones using
three.js.

[Webapp for doing a pack-of-cards workout](https://github.com/BobbyBobster/fitdex) \
Web API's such as Service workers and concepts like PWA.
