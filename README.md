Hi, I'm Bastiaan Boland. Welcome to my GitHub profile.
Currently I'm learning Scheme (via [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)),
and Racket (via [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/)).
Oh, and I'm looking for a job.

### Education
B.Sc. Econometrics and Operations Research at the University of Groningen.

The repository for my 
[Bachelor's thesis Econometrics and Operations Research](https://github.com/BobbyBobster/thesis-panel-data/)
contains the full paper and all code used. All analysis was done in R.

### Interests
* C++
* WebAssembly
* Scheme
* R
* Domain Specific Languages
* DevOps
* Bahasa Indonesia
* Vim

### Miscellaneous
[How much faster is WebAssembly compared to JavaScript?](mandelbrot/mandelbrot.html) \
WebAssembly and the Emscripten workflow. Also first contact with S-expressions 
leading to interest in Lisp/Scheme/Racket.

[Chaotic attractors](chaotic/chaotic.html) \
JavaScript, canvas, and creating pretty pictures. Might add some 3D ones using
three.js.

[Webapp for doing a pack-of-cards workout](https://github.com/BobbyBobster/fitdex) \
Web API's such as Service workers and concepts like PWA.
