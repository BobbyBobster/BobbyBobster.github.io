Hi, I'm Bastiaan Boland, if you don't yet know, I'm looking for a job in Tokyo.


### Employment
Previously I was employed at ING, one of the largest banks in Europe, as an Operations Engineer.
There I was responsible for automating the full deployment process of two applications,
one hosted on Linux (RHEL), the other on Windows Server. Next to this I was responsible for all
day-to-day operations of those applications, as well as third-party risk management of a number
of SaaS applications. I gained knowledge and expertise in DevOps best-practices, risk and security management,
and system administration. During my time at ING I also took on the Scrum Master role for ~3 years,
fulfilled the Product Owner role ad interim for ~8 months.


### Education
B.Sc. Econometrics and Operations Research at the University of Groningen. \
The repository for my 
[Bachelor's thesis Econometrics and Operations Research](https://github.com/BobbyBobster/thesis-panel-data/)
contains the full paper and all code used. All analysis was done in R.

At UG I finished courses like [Neural Networks](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WBAI028-05) 
and [Languages and Machines](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WBCS027-05). 

I also finished all three parts of the 
[C/C++ course by Frank B. Brokken and Jurjen Bokma](http://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/), 
covering OOP, advanced allocation and class construction schemes, 
generic algorithms, STL, templates, template meta-programming, 
basics of grammar and code-generating tools, and more.

The [MIT CSAIL Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) helped my 
understanding of digital workflows and the tools available for using computers
to solve problems.

Currently studying to take the JLPT N4 exam in upcoming July.
